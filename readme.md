# Chatting with multiple PDF files

## Introduction
This project is all about retrieving information from multiple PDF files at the same time. In the process of integrating the ChatPDF API into the GitHub project for managing multiple large PDF files, several observations emerged regarding its functionality and suitability for our requirements.

## Experience with ChatPDF API
### Integration Efforts
Upon attempting to incorporate the ChatPDF API into our project workflow, it became evident that certain limitations existed within its capabilities.
### Limitations Identified
- **Inadequate Support for Multiple Files**: The API's inability to handle multiple PDF files concurrently posed a significant challenge. Our project necessitated the management of numerous PDF documents, rendering this limitation problematic.
- **Logic Errors and Inaccurate Retrievals**: Notably, the API demonstrated instances of logic errors and inaccuracies in retrieving information from PDF documents. Despite tailored queries, the API occasionally yielded incorrect or irrelevant results.
